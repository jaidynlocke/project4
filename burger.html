	<p>shake shack is to over priced and you don't get what you payed for. The big thing with shake shack burgers are the fact that they use a smash burger patty, which allows the burger to get a better crust and cook faster. But the thing with shake shack is that the burger is too small for $5.29. At IN'N'OUT you can get a drink, fries and a cheeseburger for the same price.</p>
